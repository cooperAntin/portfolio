# Divergent-Faction-Test

This program acts as a sort of quiz to sort the user into one of five Factions, based on the fictional Divergent series. Each Faction is based around a certain personality trait, 
and the faction the user is sorted into is meant to represent what quality that best describes that person or is most important to that person. There are five possible Factions that the quiz 
may sort the user into:

AMNITY- Kind, forgiving, peaceful  
ABNEGATION- Selfless  
CANDOR- Honest, open  
DAUNTLESS- Brave  
ERUDITE- Intelligent   

Alternatively, like in the series 'Divergent', a person can be classified as 'Divergent', a person who fits into multiple categories. However, also as in the series, the chances of being sorted as such are 
immensley improbable.
