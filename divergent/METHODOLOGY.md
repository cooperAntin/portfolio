I, like many, enjoy taking the Divergent Faction tests that are available online. But one of the problems with it, in my view, is that it is sort of obvious how you need to answer in order to get a certain result. It's also entirely dependent on the test-taker being honest with themselves, and also having a good handle on how they would actually respond in a given situation. These, to me, seem like limitations that seriously undermine the credibility of such quizes. 


For this program, the person's Faction is determined by how long they hesitate to answer scenerios associated with a certain Faction. 

For example, if the program were testing for Candor (honesty) it would present the user with a scenerio that requires them to lie or act deceptively. 

Similiarily, if it were testing for Erudite (intelligence/knowledge), it would present the user with a scenerio where they have to make a decision with incomplete information. 

Most of the questions are incompatable with one of the five virtues/Factions being tested. If the user hesitates to answer on questions where they are unable to answer along the lines of a given virtue, that would seem to indicate that that virtue is especially important to their decision making process. Thus, that virtue is indicated as their Faction. 

A few of the questions were sort of "control" questions that don't count towards the Faction the user is sorted into. They simply exist to make it difficult for the user to anticipate how the test is determining their Faction, or in the case of the last question, to present a relatively easy question to boost the user's confidence at the end of what might have been a difficult quiz!

I feel the need to mention too that for many, if not all of the questions, neither of the responses you are given were ethical. This was deliberate, in order to determine which virtues, when unattainable, cause the user to hestiate the longest. 

Finally, the "Divergent" result can be given only if the user takes exactly the same amount of time to answer questions pertaining to more than one Faciton. (Be that two or all five.) As the amount of time is measured rather precisely, however, this is unlikely
